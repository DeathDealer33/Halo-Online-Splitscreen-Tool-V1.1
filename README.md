KB/Mouse for one instance

V1.1*

No need for multiple installs

Automatic controller enabling/port handling

Automatically size, rename, strip borders, and places windows based on a very simple selection

Save install directory so it can ask you only once for that.

Configures Audio so no overlapping music tracks but instead one for all instances.

Revert all settings so switching between single player and multiplayer with this will be seamless.


## Planned features

Slightly better UI
